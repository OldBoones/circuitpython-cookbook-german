This is a simple library to interact with mmwave radar "human presence detection"
devices, like the LD2410. (Currently, the only thing supported, but I'm intending
this to be generalizable to other sensors which work in a similar way.)

It's intended to be simple and straightforward, and particularly meant for use
with CircuitPython on microcontrollers. Therefore, it expects to have a serial-port-like
object passed in which implements read(number of bytes) and write(buffer of bytes).

See README.md for more!
